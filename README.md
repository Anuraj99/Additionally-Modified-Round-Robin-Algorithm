# Additionally-Modified-Round-Robin-Algorithm
A modification of the conventional Round-Robin Algorithm along with implementation in C


Abstract:
There are various CPU scheduling algorithms are used to performed multiprogramming like First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling (PS) and Round Robin (RR). This project deals with the simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms with C. The following algorithms are simulated:

• First Come First Serve (FCFS)

• Shortest Job First

• SRTF Algorithm

• Round Robin

• Our innovative algorithm


The target of this project is to also propose a new CPU scheduling algorithm which will perform superior than current round robin algorithm and in most cases better than other algorithms as well in terms of minimizing average waiting time, average turnaround time and number of context switches.
